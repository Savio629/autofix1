# Autofix1

There still needs to be a lot of fixes and the code can be improved...

The following is the errors for which autofix works:
- asyncapi-latest-version:
- asyncapi-schema
  - 'url' property type must be string
  - 'description' property type must be string
- asyncapi-info-contact-properties:
- asyncapi-tags-uniqueness:

## Comparison: Mocha vs. Jest for Testing TypeScript Extensions

Mocha and Jest are popular testing frameworks and can be used for testing TypeScript extensions. As part of our Google Season of Code 2023 project we are already working on creating autofixes for Asyncapi Preview extension.We need a quick vote between these two Unit testing Tools.  While they share some similarities, there are few differences between them.

| Feature                 | Mocha                                | Jest                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Test Runner             | Mocha provides a flexible test runner | Jest includes its own test runner   |
| Configuration           | Separate configuration files (`mocharc.js` or .`mocharc.cjs`)        | Uses a predefined `jest.config.js`   |
| Assertion Library       | Choose your preferred library (No built-in library)         | Includes built-in `expect` library |
| Code Coverage           | Additional libraries like Istanbul    | Built-in code coverage reporting    |
| Parallel Test Execution | Additional libraries like `mocha-parallel-tests` | Built-in support for parallel execution |
| Snapshot Testing        | Additional libraries like `chai-jest-snapshot` | Built-in support for snapshot testing |

### Explanation of Features:

1. **Test Runner:** Mocha provides a flexible test runner that allows user to organize and execute tests. Jest, on the other hand, includes its own test runner, which simplifies the setup process.

2. **Configuration:** Mocha requires separate configuration files like `mocharc.js` or .`mocharc.cjs` to define settings. Jest, on the other hand, uses a predefined `jest.config.js` file for configuring various aspects of the testing framework.

3. **Assertion Library:** Mocha does not include a built-in assertion library, giving developers the freedom to choose their preferred library such as Chai or Node.js' for `assert` module. Jest, however, includes its own built-in `expect` library with a wide range of assertion functions.

5. **Code Coverage:** Mocha does not provide built-in code coverage reporting.Will have to use additional libraries like Istanbul in conjunction with Mocha to generate code coverage reports. Jest, however, includes built-in code coverage reporting, simplifying the process of tracking and visualizing code coverage metrics.

6. **Parallel Test Execution:** Mocha executes tests sequentially by default, but we can use additional libraries like `mocha-parallel-tests` to run tests in parallel. Jest, on the other hand, supports concurrent test execution out of the box, potentially reducing overall test execution time.

7. **Snapshot Testing:** Mocha does not have built-in snapshot testing capabilities. We have to use additional libraries like `chai-jest-snapshot` to enable snapshot testing with Mocha. Jest, however, provides built-in support for snapshot testing, making it easier to capture and compare the output of functions or components.

In terms of cost, both Mocha and Jest are free and open-source testing frameworks, so there are no direct costs associated with using them for testing TypeScript extensions.

Mocha is the best solution for a huge project that requires flexibility and customization. Jest is the best alternative if it is a smaller project and don't require the extra setup and configuration upfront.It is also better alternative when a lightweight, uncomplicated testing solution is needed and is also speedier than Mocha.
